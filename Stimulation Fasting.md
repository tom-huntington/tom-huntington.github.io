# Stimulation Fasting

I'm addicted to brain stimulation.
* Learning - youtube, google, chatGPT, stackoverflow.
* Programming.
* Projects.
* Original ideas.

However, I find that my productivity crashes if I spend too many hours in the day stimulating by brain.

For example, I might spend 9am to 5pm programming,
and then spend the evening learning something difficult.

Spending the evening too stimulated makes me less productive on tomorrows 9 to 5.

To be productive, I need to do Stimulation Fasting.
However, being unstimulated is unpleasant.
It's difficult to spend the evening fasting.


By less productive I mean a decrease in my IQ.
This wont be on G.
But likely a lot of my high intelligence is really a massive flynn effect.
Without this Flynn effect I am really below average.

I was better at stimulation fasting at university.
This probably accounted for my relative success.
