# Introduce Parameter
You have written some code that gets some behaviour working.
You now have to support a second behaviour.
You have to extract out the some of the existing behaviour into a function.
Then you have to [introduce a parameter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings__Introduce_Parameter.html)
You can then polymorphically initialize the argument to acheive polymorphism.
This is how you write reusable code.
